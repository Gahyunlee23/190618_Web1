# TRAA Midterm Review
Going over some stuff that almost everyone got slightly worng. Not major stuff, so don;t feel bad, but minor stuff we don't want to keep going.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Use CSS3 and HTML5 lastest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc(see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference) Also using lastest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Bable](https://babeljs.io/) for transipilation (or an NPM script)

### Installing

cd directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
